    "This is likely the easiest step in the notebook. Simply naviagte to [the Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) to download their latest distribution of Python, packaged with everything you will need. Use the default installation settings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once Anaconda is installed, you can check to make sure things worked correctly by opening \"Anaconda Prompt\" (a program found under the \"Home\" tab in the Anaconda Navigator or by searching directly on your machine). After opening Anaconda, enter the following command: \n",
    "```\n",
    "> python\n",

    "Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n",
    "```\n",
    "This displays your current python version and, if it prints, everything should be running correctly. If there are any errors, you may need to reinstall Anaconda or Python.

    "Python packages are sort of like toolboxes in that they allow you to use a screwdriver without having to build the screwdriver from scratch everytime you need it. For example, we will install a package called [physoce](https://github.com/physoce/physoce-py) which will allow you to calculate the wind stress from wind velocity without having to do all the intermediate steps in such a calculation everytime you need it. That said, you should still make an effort to understand what a package is doing before you use it blindly - they are not \"black boxes\" and are liable to fail sometimes, especially lesser used oceanographic data packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before installing anything, we should first understand how to *manage* packages (which is often a bigger hurdle than installing them in the first place). Sometimes packages or Python versions don't play nice with one another, so keeping things in separate \"environments\" will allow us to prevent any issues (or at least isolate them if they do pop up!). This may not be important when you are just starting your coding journey, but once you have separate packages for oceanographic analysis, application development, machine learning, and anything else, you will really start to run into problems if they are all fighting each other in your default environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "As one last brief aside before getting into things, you will notice the keywords *conda* and *pip* pop up a lot from here on out. These are simply package managers which enable and assist us in our valiant efforts towards organization and control. There is much more detail I could go into about these managers, but it is a bit outside the scope of this topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we are just going to set up a fresh environment for your oceanographic data analysis. Feel free to name it whatever you like. We also specify a specific Python version in this step, which is a very important part of package management (some packages only work on specific Python versions, so we will install version 3.9 since I have verified all the packages work with this). You can also install packages in this step, but we will leave that until later.\n",
    "```\n",
    "> conda create -n env_name python=3.9\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that by specifying a Python version, we also install a few basic packages such as pip (another package manager). When prompted if you would like to continue, press ```y``` and hit enter. If your environment creation was successful, you can run the following lines to activate your new environment.\n",
    "```\n",
    "> conda deactivate\n",
    "> conda activate env_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, instead of (base) or (default) in the parentheses, you should now see (env_name). Nice job, our environment is successfully created! Make sure you remember to activate your environment (run the last two lines) whenever you go to do oceanographic coding, or you will be left without your packages. Now on to installing packages."

See [here](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/getting-started-guide/installing.html#instructions) for more details. You may also be interested in installing the optional visualization or acceleration package dependencies for xarray, as well as the eccodes package which allows reading of [GRIB files](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/What+are+GRIB+files+and+how+can+I+read+them), which can be installed with: \n",
