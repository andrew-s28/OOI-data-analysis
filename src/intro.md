# Introduction

This is a rough introduction that takes a user through installing Python, setting up a Python environment, some basics on package mangement, and an overview of accessing and plotting data from the [Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI)](https://oceanobservatories.org/) [THREDDS server](https://thredds.dataexplorer.oceanobservatories.org/thredds/catalog/ooigoldcopy/public/catalog.html). It is intended for a user with little Python experience and does not cover data quality and control for downloaded data. Therefore, this guide should be used as an introduction to some of the code necessary to access and use these data but should not be used for rigorous scientific analysis. Basically, use your own judgement. 

The code and concepts used in this guide come from a wide range of sources, many from mentors of mine over the years. Thanks in particular to the folks at the OOI who have provdied me with analysis code and helped me better understand the OOI data.
